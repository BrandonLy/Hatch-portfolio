excerpt: Resourcefulness can prove to be a useful tool for virtually anybody, but particularly students and professionals. The ability to use one’s environment to his or her advantage is likely to pave a sound path to achievement. During my Human Diseases course, we were told to craft a large-scale animal cell with anything at our disposal, with obvious adherence to accurate Biology. Not only could the projects be tangible, but they could act as more than just a tactile and visual aide--mine, in particular, was a freshly made pizza with each topping representing a different component of the cell. The model was successful in communicating the information, and was enjoyed by the entire class.
