##Content Knowledge

This tenet of learning governs students’ understanding of conveyed material, and is often weighted most prominently due to its vital nature. My most noteworthy account of content knowledge demonstration was enacted during my participation in a newspaper production simulation as part of my World History curriculum. Using knowledge we learned in and outside of the classroom through books, written assignments, and lectures, we were tasked with creating a detailed news report that would resemble one conceived during the Industrial Era; the production encompassed objective reporting, poetic analysis, and precise essayism.
