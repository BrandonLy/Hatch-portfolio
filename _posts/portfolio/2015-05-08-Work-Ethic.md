excerpt: Strict attention to deadlines and responsibility reflects professional readiness on the part of their host, and they are, indeed, a force of benevolence. Unlike the learning tenets listed above, work ethic consigns no specific project to its nature, because its nature is universal; every project incorporates it, and without it, assignments are wholly dismantled. In this sense, it can be deduced that all academic tasks are proponents of a student’s willingness to actually complete them and turn them in, and that they are all considered in the same regard.

##Work Ethic

Strict attention to deadlines and responsibility reflects professional readiness on the part of their host, and they are, indeed, a force of benevolence. Unlike the learning tenets listed above, work ethic consigns no specific project to its nature, because its nature is universal; every project incorporates it, and without it, assignments are wholly dismantled. In this sense, it can be deduced that all academic tasks are proponents of a student’s willingness to actually complete them and turn them in, and that they are all considered in the same regard.
