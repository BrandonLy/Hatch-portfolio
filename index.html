	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class="about">
		As a student, I want to heighten my achievements in a way that will make me stand out from the crowd. My belief is that no amount of academic effort is insubstantial, because academic goals create a path that is intrinsically promising. The expansive vistas of the mind welcome learning because it is what prompts us to grow. After high school, I plan to further pursue an education in the field of medicine, attending the University of Nevada, Reno as a neuroscience major. Using knowledge gained in my alma mater years, I aspire to contribute to the insurmountable study as either a scientifically or clinically-based researcher.
